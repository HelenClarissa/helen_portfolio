**MyRoom Project Description**

MyRoom is a mobile application that focus on providing a marketplace where users may find and assign professional interior designers to help them in designing their space. Our goal in developing this application is to provide customers an easier way to reach an interior design services and to expand job opportunities for freelance interior designers. How our application works is that users who has created an account within our application may choose to be either customer (regular mode) or register as a designer (professional mode). 
user who choose to be customer will be able first brought to the homepage where they are able to find features such as the "featured designers today" to help customers to find designer they want to collaborate with, their current on going porject and quick access to the chat box between customers and chosen designer, as well as several portfolio recommendation from various interior designer that have been program to match the customer past project styles preferences. there are also option to either "design" or "service". if customer chosen "deisgn" then the project will end when designer sent the prototype to customer. on the other hand, the "service" option will end when the design have been build physically according to the prototype discussed by both parties. To help customer choose their designer we have provided information such as profile and description written by the deisgner themself, community rating given by previous customers that have worked with the same designer and expert rating given by other designers that have done project together. there are also estimated budget, furnitures used by the designer in their previous project, and gallery of the designer's finished project to help customer decide to whether they want to make a contract with said designer. other features within the app is that we provide refrences in the app to help user finding ideas easier by inputing keyword to the provided search bar.   
while user who register as a designer will need to submit their portfolio and complete their public profile which will later be verified by the admin to ensure the user credibility. Afterward, they may receieve a request from customer that is interested to start a project with them. After confirming the request both parties are given a platform to communicate with each other and share their ideas.

# Project 4 : Classification and Clustering In Machine Learning (Big Data)

1. Helen Clarissa - 2201762130


**Classification In Machine Learning**
creating a predictive model that will classify whether a planet is likely to be habitable or not based on given collected data in Planet_Training.csv and Planet_Testing.csv. The step will be done by first Load Data then select the feature which will be process and later transformed the raw data into suitable for training then normalized before generate the model and output the testing evaluation to confirm credibility.

**Clustering In Machine Learning**
make a clustering model that will have 2 cluster, grizzly bear cluster and non-grizzly bear cluster based on given collected data in “BearTraining.csv” and “BearTesting.csv”.The step will be done by first Load Data then select the feature which will be process and later transformed the raw data into suitable for training then normalized before generate the model and output the testing evaluation to confirm credibility.
